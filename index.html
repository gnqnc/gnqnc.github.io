            <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Second Opinion Visits</h3>
            <p>
                This is a growing phenomenon when a patient goes to see another specialist in the same field for a
                second opinion.
                A recent study conducted at Mayo clinic indicated that as many as 88% of patients who came for a 2nd
                opinion, ended
                up with an alternative diagnosis, and with this new diagnosis their plan of care was changed and so were
                their lives.
            </p>
            <p>Neurology with its complexity and confounding factors like polypharmacy, chronic medical
                problems,
                occupational injuries, and psychiatric issues, is a field where a misdiagnosis is more likely.
            </p>
            <p>Dr. Nikolskaya offers second opinion visits and hopes to spare patients from unnecessary burden of wrong
                medications, numerous tests and
                imaging and increase patient’s quality of life one correct diagnosis at a time. </p>

                    <blah>During my pregnancy I had trouble finding a Neurologist I could trust to make safe treatment
                        decisions for both baby and I. Luckily, I found Dr. Nikolskaya who is very knowledgeable and has
                        the
                        best bedside manner. She always follows up and stands up for me when it comes to referrals. If
                        you
                        want a Dr that is on top of her cases I highly recommend her. Thank you Dr Galina Nikolskaya for
                        being so kind and taking care of me!
