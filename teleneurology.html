            <h4 style="margin-top: 40px;">How tele-neurology visit can lead to quicker improvement in health and quality
                of life</h4>
            <p>Let’s imagine a hypothetical patient by a name of Marie Jane. This patient has severe debilitating
                migraines and has not seen her primary care doctor in quite some time. She is a busy professional and
                finds it difficult to take time off work for doctor’s visits, she only gets 6 sick days per year. This
                patient finally takes a day off work to go see her family physician, who after hearing her story sends
                her a referral to see a neurologist. This patient continues to have the same amount of headaches and it
                takes about 4 months to get an appointment with a neurologist. She takes another day off work to see
                this doctor but on her way to the office gets stuck in LA traffic and arrives 30 min late to her
                appointment. Thus her appointment gets pushed back another 2 months. Now 6 months after the initial
                contact with her primary care doctor, she takes a 3rd day of work driving 1 hr to finally see the
                specialist who takes her history, does exam and starts her on a medication that helps reduce her
                headaches. She is bewildered as to why 6 months passed before her issue was addressed, and all of her
                sick days have been used up at work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here’s how a similar scenario would play out with if this patient chose to rely on tele-neurology
                service.
            </p>
            <p>
                Patient sets up a virtual consultation during her off work time. On Sunday afternoon, in the comfort of
                her home, in front of her laptop, she shares her story, doctor evaluates her for asymmetry in exam, and
                then makes the same diagnosis and treatment plan. The patient does not have to take a single day off
                work. Within a few days after starting on the medication, she is starting to feel better. Instead of
                suffering for 6 months with many headaches, losing days of productivity, she is able to be at her best
                with family and at work. Due to her recent teleneurology visit, she saved hours of precious time,
                improved her health faster due to less headaches. She is sleeping better, eating healthier, feeling less
                stressed, and exercising more due to reduction in headaches. Overall her life has improved, and it did
                so without a 6 month wait time.
