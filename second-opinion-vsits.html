            <h2>Second Opinion Visits</h2>
            <h4><i>Is there a value in a second opinion neurological consult?</i></h4>
            <p>
                Second opinion, when patient goes to see another specialist in the same field, is a growing phenomenon.
                More and more major institutions and 2nd opinion consulting agencies are offering this service to
                patients. There was even a study published recently in the Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice
                conducting at Mayo clinic indicating that as many as 88% of patients who came for a 2nd opinion, ended
                up with an alternative diagnosis, and with this new diagnosis their plan of care was changed and so were
                their lives. Only astonishing 12% of patients that sought 2nd opinion learned that their initial
                diagnosis was indeed correct.
            </p>
            <p>Neurology with its complexity and confounding factors like polypharmacy, chronic medical problems,
                occupational injuries, and psychiatric issues, is a field where rate of misdiagnosis is likely much
                higher. While in the Mayo study, 1 out of 5 patients was misdiagnosed by an internal medicine physician,
                in neurology, I would estimate, it is about 1 out 3 patients that end up with a completely different
                diagnosis by the end of the 2nd opinion visit.
            </p>
            <p>So what is the reason for this degree of medical error in a standard neurological practice? The reasons
                are many, but one major factor is increasing shortage of neurologists. Because of this many primary care
                doctors end up treating neurological diseases and by the time patient ends up seeing a neurologist, the
                disease may have progressed and valuable time was lost. The neurologist that ends up taking over the
                care of some of these patients does not have the early signs that are helpful to make a much more
                specific diagnosis, and can end up re-prescribing the same medication. I call this sort of practice
                “maintaining status quo care” or “do not rock the boat” treatment plan with neurologist keeping the same
                plan originally started by a primary care physician that is inappropriate for the disease process.
            </p>
            <p>Even if a patient is lucky to get evaluated by the neurologist at the very beginning of the symptom
                onset, it is still not a guarantee this patient will end up with the correct diagnosis. The reason for
                this may have to do with the degree of burnout experienced by neurologists.
            </p>
            <p>According to 2017 study by the American Academy of Neurology, 60% of neurologists in the United States
                are experiencing some form of burnout. The implications of the burned out physician are that the quality
                of care suffers. Burned out neurologists lack compassion and empathy, feeling detached from the humanity
                aspect of medicine, and presence of compassion and empathy are vital to understanding the root cause of
                patient’s neurological complaints. Burned out neurologists simply cannot practice medicine to the same
                degree of quality as those that are not burned out, and that is only 40% of the neurologist in the US.
                Understandably, patients’ misdiagnosis and mistreatment occurs more commonly for those patients who end
                up in the hands of a burned out specialist who is “checked out” and is just going through the motions,
                treating patients like objects just to get to the end of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                But this gets worse. With the unappealing statistics of neurologists being one of the most burned out
                specialists while being the least compensated for their services and having the worst work to life
                balance comparing to other specialists, fewer medical students end up pursuing neurology residency thus
                less neurologists are available to handle the neuro issues. At the same time, as baby boomers age,
                people living longer developing neuro issues, health problems becoming more complex, the need for
                appropriate knowledge and management of neurological diseases is only increasing. Thus we end up with a
                vicious cycle where neurologists are even more overwhelmed and overworked and primary care physicians
                end up being the ones managing the majority of neurological diseases, despite not being trained at
                neurological pattern recognition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another factor is that some neurologists, particularly the ones practicing neurology in the private
                practice setting, are at the mercy of government reimbursement for the services. There have been cuts to
                neurological procedures of up to 40% and some private practice neurologists can no longer afford to stay
                in practice and compete with large institutions and hospitals. Thus neurologists end up getting employed
                by these hospitals that operate on RVU model, i.e. productivity incentivised model. This leads to the
                doctor being like a hamster on a treadmill, on average having only 20 minutes to spend with the
                follow-up patient, 45 min with the new patient, of which 80% is spent staring and typing on the laptop.
                I have been to many hospital employed neurology practices and doctors there are quite stressed out. They
                don’t even get a proper lunch break, gobbling down sandwiches while answering patient’s emails or phone
                calls, or attending to some urgent administrative matter. These neurologists see their last patient at
                4:30 pm but still go home only after 6 or 7 pm due to having to finish those notes in their EMR systems,
                making sure all of the quality measures have been met, so that government does not fine them later on.
            </p>
            <p>Some of my patients tell me that neurologists in those practices spent with them about 10 minutes, and
                sometimes as little as 2 minutes. This is usually in a practice where a nurse practitioner, medical
                assistant or a physician assistant is employed for the sole purpose of cutting down on the physician’s
                time with patient. The midlevel provider asks the questions and spends majority of the time with the
                patient, followed by physician walking in, quickly examining the patient and saying good buy after just
                a few minutes of interaction. The consequence of such a limited time spent by the neurologist evaluating
                the patient can be erroneous diagnosis with wrongful choice of treatment.
            </p>
            <p>The correctness of neurological diagnosis depends highly on the thoroughness of the neurologist obtaining
                history of present illness. Good history taking sometimes makes ancillary testing unnecessary. The types
                of questions asked of a patient depend on the interviewer’s deep understanding of human brain,
                musculoskeletal and nervous system. If most of the questions are asked by a midlevel provider or a PCP,
                then the quality of the obtained information may be compromised.
            </p>
            <p>So is it surprising why so many of neurological patients, with whom 2nd opinion experts spend three times
                longer than a typical neurologist, end up with a new diagnosis and a revised treatment plan?
            </p>
            <p>Let me share a couple of stories highlighting the danger of misdiagnosis in neurology.
            </p>
            <p>I had a patient that came to me for a 2nd opinion, who was heartbroken when was diagnosed with a
                neurodegenerative condition, called Parkinson’s disease based on head tremor. After thorough
                examination, it was found that the actual diagnosis was dystonic tremor of the neck from the neck
                muscles pulling head forward (anterocollis). I now treat that patient successfully every 3 months with
                botulinum toxin injection and as a result, the tremor and the neck pain have fully resolved. This
                patient was relieved that dire diagnosis of Parkinson’s was incorrect. Fortunately this patient came for
                a 2nd opinion before having been started on parkinson specific medication which would have exacerbated
                the tremor and caused the neck to spasm more. The patient also may have gotten an unnecessary brain PET
                scan which would have cost a significant amount of money.

            </p>
            <p>What about the big name universities, don’t they guarantee to provide a correct diagnosis?
            </p>
            <p>Academic establishments are now offering 2nd opinion consults remotely, via teleservices and it might be
                a great option for some. However, here are a couple of examples that speak to the notion that big name
                does not necessarily translate to the highest quality of neurological care. I saw a patient who ended up
                with an invasive deep brain stimulator implanted device for something that could have been handled with
                cognitive behavioral therapy and an anti-depressant. This patient had somatic symptom disorder where
                psychiatric symptoms manifest in physical symptoms, in this case, muscle spasms. The original
                misdiagnosis of refractory generalized dystonia came from the highly reputable university that had
                arranged for the patient to get deep brain stimulation, which only made the symptoms worse post surgery.
            </p>
            <p>There was another patient I saw for a 2nd opinion who went to the center of excellence at another big
                university with multidisciplinary specialists.The patient paid out of pocket hundreds of dollars. The
                neurologist there spent 20 minutes just to tell the patient he did not know what the diagnosis was, did
                not do a thoroughly exam, did not look at the tongue. When the patient came to me, I spent an hour and
                my neurological examination revealed tongue and muscle fasciculations and atrophy with EMG later
                confirming the diagnosis of ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). This patient is now receiving treatment for ALS
                that became available this year.

            </p>
            <p>To conclude, with more awareness of the fact that neurology is a field with high chance of a wrong
                diagnosis, my hope is to spare patients from unnecessary burden of wrong medications, numerous tests and
                imaging and increase patient’s quality of life one correct diagnosis at a time.
