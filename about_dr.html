                conduction studies, acquired additional expertise in neuromuscular disorders, epilepsy, vagal nerve
                stimulator programming, and botulinum toxin treatment of various neurological conditions. She has an

            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Nikoslkaya's knowledgeable and personable approach contributed to her winning recognition during a Spring 2017
                HealthTap Best Doctor competition as the Top 1 Neurologist in the Orange Country Region. In her private
                practice she consistently receives the highest patient satisfaction feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                She is passionate about helping patients reach their wellness goals and believes in preventative care.
                She will coach patients on appropriate health habits, including holistic approaches, and will advise on
                strategies for wellbeing. She firmly believes in giving the patients as much time as possible to express
                their concerns. She did 1 year of internal medicine training and continued to manage internal medicine
                issues throughout her training in adult neurology and throughout her time of private practice as a
                neurologist, thus she frequently ends up addressing both neurological and non-neurological issues during
                her visits, to optimize patientâ€™s overall health.
